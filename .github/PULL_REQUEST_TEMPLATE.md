### Mocked request data and data model checklist:

**Data checks:**
Updates were made to the mocked incoming request data and/or mocked published request data:

- [ ] Unit tests were updated in relation to updates to the mocked test data.

If no unit tests were updated or added, then please explain why: [insert details here]

**Describe your testing environment:**

- NATS [local, local docker, dev server, production]
- Neo4j [local, local docker, dev server, production]

### General checklist:
- [ ] All requested changes and comments have been resolved.
- [ ] The commit log is comprehensible. It follows [7 rules of great commit messages](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). For most PRs a single commit should suffice, in some cases multiple topical commits can be useful. During review it is ok to see tiny commits (e.g. Fix reviewer comments), but right before the code gets merged to master or rc branch, any such commits should be squashed since they are useless to the other developers. Definitely avoid [merge commits, use rebase instead.](http://nathanleclaire.com/blog/2014/09/14/dont-be-scared-of-git-rebase/)
